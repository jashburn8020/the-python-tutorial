# The Python Tutorial

Examples from [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) (Python 3.7.4)

These examples are written as pytest 3 test cases. To run them, you can either:
- `pytest-3 testfile`
- `chmod 755 testfile` and then `./testfile` if pytest is available at `/usr/bin/pytest-3` (or change the test files' shebang to match the location of pytest)
